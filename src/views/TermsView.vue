            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to the magical, whimsical land of CALENDRIFY. By using our calendar service, you agree to the
              following terms and conditions. Read them carefully, as failure to do so may result in spontaneous bursts
              of laughter, confusion, or uncontrollable dancing.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="terms-section">
            <h3>2. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>By clicking "I Agree," you have officially agreed to these terms in a way that is both legally binding
              and morally questionable. We wonâ€™t judge, but we will be watching... metaphorically, of course.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="terms-section">
            <h3>3. What We Do (And Donâ€™t Do)</h3>
            <p>We promise to provide our calendar service, but we donâ€™t promise it will always be perfect. Sometimes,
              even unicorns trip over rainbows. We will try our best, though! However, if you experience an unexpected
              teleportation to a different dimension, we are not responsible for any emotional baggage.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="terms-section">
            <h3>4. Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, and favorite ice cream flavor. We
              promise not to share it with anyone except maybe our pet hamster, Sir Wigglesworth, who has a really good
              sense of humor. But seriously, we respect your privacy, and we wonâ€™t sell your data to space aliens or
              your ex.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="terms-section">
            <h3>5. Use of Our Service</h3>
            <p>You agree to use our calendar service in a way thatâ€™s kind and respectful. This includes not sending us a
              thousand "hello" messages, and definitely no unsolicited sock puppet performances. If youâ€™re unsure
              whether something is appropriate, assume itâ€™s not, and then do it anyway because we probably wonâ€™t
              mind.</p>

            <h3>6. No Boring Stuff</h3>
            <p>While we try to make our terms as entertaining as possible, we still have to get through some boring
              legal stuff:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You canâ€™t break the internet.</li>
              <li>You canâ€™t hack us (unless youâ€™re a friendly hacker with a pizza).</li>
              <li>You agree not to use our service for any illegal activities like summoning ancient spirits or
                attempting to steal the moon.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="terms-section">
            <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>We are not liable for any sudden bouts of happiness, uncontrollable giggling, or spontaneous breakdancing
              caused by using our calendar service. Use at your own risk, because we canâ€™t be responsible for you
              becoming too cool for school.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="terms-section">
            <h3>8. Updates to Terms</h3>
            <p>From time to time, we may change these terms. If we do, weâ€™ll send you an owl or maybe a carrier pigeon.
              If you don't see one, just check your inbox. If itâ€™s empty, then well, you know, maybe donâ€™t sweat it.</p>

          <div class="terms-section">
            <h3>9. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have questions or just want to send us a funny meme, feel free to reach out! We love memes. Drop
              us a line at info@calendrify.eu â€”we may or may not respond with a GIF.</p>
